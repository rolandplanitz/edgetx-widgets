# ModelWidget
... now with options to change the visual representation.
The defaults are set to keep everything as it was before.

## Options

**show_nick**  
Show text defined in `nick` instead of the model name.
That helps to have different model names while still having a nice screen,
for e.g. stick cams of fancy pictures for social media.

**nick**  
The text displayed instead of the model name when `show_nick` is enabled.
