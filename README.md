## Known Issues
- **BetaFPV Flight Controllers**: Some BetaFPV flight controllers (e.g., Air 65 or Air 75) report battery 0V RxBT. This may cause the voltage to not display properly. Ensure that if a metric is not displayed, it appears in the telemetry; otherwise, it will not be shown.

## Troubleshooting
- **Widget Not Showing Up**: Ensure the widget folder is placed correctly under `/WIDGETS/` and contains all required files.
- **SD Card Issues**: Verify the card is formatted correctly (e.g., FAT32).
- **Compatibility**: Ensure the widget is compatible with your EdgeTX version.
- **Switching Drones**: Every time you switch drones without restarting the radio transmitter, make sure you reset the telemetry. To reset telemetry:
  1. Navigate to the **Model Settings** on your transmitter.
  2. Go to the **Telemetry** page.
  3. Select **Reset telemetry**.

## Uninstallation
1. Navigate to your SD card's `/WIDGETS/` directory.
2. Delete the folders corresponding to the widget you wish to remove.
